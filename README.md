Infinity Scroll Functionality

As the user scrolls to the bottom of the page another network request is made,
but it happens before you reach the bottom so you don't see it and it feels like
you seamlessly scrolling forever.

The images are photos fetched from the unsplash API and we're tracking the moment
all the images are loaded in order to dynamically hide our loading animation.
